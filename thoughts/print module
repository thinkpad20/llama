```
module Print

import from System: stdout, write
import from Show: Show

export print, println

print (x: Show, @output=stdout) = output.write x.show
println (x: Show, @output: File) = print ("#{x}\n", output=output)
```

One issue: a namespaced method makes `.` notation kinda ugly. For example:

```
module Foo
export foo
foo (n: Num) = n * 6
```

```
> import Foo
> print $ Foo/foo 4
24
> print 4.Foo/foo
24
```


The latter is a little harder to read. It's worse if it's longer:

```
> import System
> my_file = System/open ("foo.txt", mode='w')
> my_file.System/close after my_file.System/write "hello world"
```

Meh, I suppose it's not terrible.
