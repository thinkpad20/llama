# Some feature ideas:


# function calls are left-associative:

foo bar == foo (bar)
foo bar baz = foo(bar)(baz)
foo (bar, baz) == foo(bar, baz)
foo bar, baz == (foo bar, baz)

# dot reference is left associative, higher than function call
foo.bar == bar foo
(foo bar).baz == baz(foo(bar))
foo.bar baz == foo.bar(baz) == bar foo baz == (bar foo) baz
foo bar.baz == foo (bar.baz) == foo (baz bar)
foo bar.baz qux = foo(bar.baz)(qux) == foo (baz bar) qux
# this is the parsing we want for tuples... not sure if that's hard tho
foo (bar, baz).qux == qux(foo(bar, baz))
foo ((bar, baz).qux) == foo(qux(bar, baz))
# we might have to stick with
foo (bar, baz).qux == foo(qux(bar, baz))
(foo (bar, baz)).qux == qux(foo(bar, baz))

# functions are block-structured, declare argument types:

foo (bar: [a], baz: [a]) =
  blob = bar ++ baz
  if length blob > 3
    print "oh crap"
  	max [head bar, head baz]
  else
  	blob[3]

# one thing we can do is when dealing with immutable vectors, use a

# object can be made mutable, so immutable objects are always safe to use.

# type of multiArgs = (String | Num | (String, Num) | [String]) -> ()
# we just need to ensure that all of the return types are the same. This

(-) (a: Num) = negate a
(+) (a: Num) = abs a
(+) (a: Num, b: Num) = a.add b

# and who knows what else.
# and if later on we overload foo some more, then we will just add to its type
# alternatives as appropriate...

# One issue though is namespacing with structures:
struct MyStruct = MyStruct(foo: String, bar: Num)
s = MyStruct("hello", 2)
print s.foo # prints hello
foo = k: Num => k ^ 2 * 3
print s.foo # type error here? no, should be ok
bar = s: MyStruct => s.bar * 7
# now here's the issue:
print s.bar # what? is it 2, or 14?
# probably we should make dot syntax always go to a member variable if there,
# and only if not does it make a function call, so the above prints 2.
print <| bar s # prints 14
# then the following would NOT work:
print <| foo s # (no function `foo` which takes MyStruct as its argument)
# this should allow us to reuse member variables:
struct Foo = Foo(bar: String, baz: [Num])
struct Bar = Bar(baz: Num)
baz (s: String) = s ++ "!"
print Foo ("hello", [1,2,3]).baz # [1,2,3]
print Bar (45).baz # 45
print "yo".baz # yo!
print Foo.baz.baz # hello!

# ah, we should probably _not_ make `.` bind higher than application when
# coming after a tuple... so that foo(bar, baz).qux == qux(foo(bar, baz))
# and not foo(qux(bar, baz)). 
# What if we did that, and we DID want foo(qux(bar, baz))?
# We'd write foo((bar, baz).qux)
# we could play around in parsec until we get this exact behavior...
